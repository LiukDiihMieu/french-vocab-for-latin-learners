# French Vocabulary by Latin & English Cognates

*A frequency-based French vocabulary aid using etymology and cross-linguistic patterns*

## 🌟 Introduction

This project provides a curated set of the **most frequent French nouns, adjectives, and verbs**, annotated with their **English meanings**, **Latin etymological roots**, and **English cognates**, when applicable.

If you are already comfortable with **English** and have some exposure to **Latin**, this approach can significantly speed up your learning. A large portion of basic French vocabulary is directly inherited from Latin or shares identifiable roots with English derivatives. Recognizing these patterns reduces memorization effort:

- Latin-derived vocabulary becomes intuitive,
- English cognates create familiar semantic connections,
- and you only need to focus intensive memorization on words from **non-Latin sources** (e.g., Frankish, Germanic, or irregular origins).

This repository transforms the raw frequency lists into structured **YAML**, **Markdown**, and **PDF** formats to support efficient vocabulary review and language study.
